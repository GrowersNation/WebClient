# WebClient - The Growers' Nation Web Client

## Technologies

* HTML5 + JavaScript
* Dojo - web framework for manipulating HTML

## Getting started

Start a web server using the `src` directory as your base with this handy python command

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
then navigate to `localhost:8080` to see the site. Any changes you make will be instantly reflected upon a refresh.

## Making changes

In general the project uses the "master-develop" branching strategy with Issues acting as branch names. This means that the latest release candidate is the head of `develop` and the current production release is the head of `master`.
